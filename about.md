  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I use my experience in research and my commitment to treat every person with dignity to help understanding how rapid environmental changes impact humans and non-humans and provide practical guidelines to improve life. 

  <p>I worked for many years as an evolutionary ecologist, investigating how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to shape organismal response to rapidly changing environment. I started my professional career as a field biologist, working with birds and mammals in Brazil. I then moved to Canada and did my PhD in Ecology, conducting experiments in controlled lab settings with model organisms such as fruit flies, waterfleas and algae. After my PhD, I worked for 6 years as a research associate investigating how changes in land use (agriculture) and climate change impact species interactions and the resilience of populations.

  <p>Recently, I became increasingly interested in understanding how these same environmental changes can impact human mental health. As part of this career change, in September 2020 I started a PhD in Public Health at the University of Waterloo to investigate the effects of climate change on mental health, including the effects of COVID-19.</p>
