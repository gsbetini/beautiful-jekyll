  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am an ecologist who investigates how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to shape organismal response to rapidly changing environments. 
  <p>Most of my work focuses on non-human organisms, but I am now working on the effects of these rapid environmental changes on human mental health.<p>
  <p>Organisms, including humans, have evolved a number of strategies to survive and reproduce in heterogeneous environments, but it is not clear 1) whether these strategies will inhibit or facilitate rapid response and potential adaptation to environmental variation that is beyond the magnitude of past selection and 2) how rapid adaptation influences species interactions, demography and extinction probabilities.
  <p>I approach these problems with an integrated framework that includes the development of new protocols in controlled laboratory settings, field-based research and mathematical modelling. This allows me to gather detailed data at the individual and population levels and combine physiological, ecological and evolutionary information to understand the drivers of fitness in changing environments.<p>
